Crimson_ExceptionHandler: A syslog friendly exception handler
=============================================================

The Crimson_ExceptionHandler is a drop-in exception handler designed to
provide exception stack traces in a syslog friend format.

The Crimson_ExceptionHandler does not force or check that PHP is logging to
syslog.  It expects the PHP ini "error_log" setting to be "syslog" before it 
catches an exception.  If the value is set to some other file, it will log to
that file instead.
